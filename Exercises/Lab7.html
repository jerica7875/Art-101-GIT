  <p> Happy.................True happiness starts with gratitude. When you feel good about who you are, the work you do, and the people around you, contentment follows. These poems are gentle reminders to take a moment, look around, and see the beauty and kindness already in your life.

  <p> Sad................... Sometimes, the emotion won’t even set in immediately. This usually happens over big events like the loss of a loved one or moving to a new place. When you least expect it, you’ll be surprised that tears are already falling on your cheeks.

  <p> Angry............... It is wise to direct your anger towards problems - not people; to focus your energies on answers - not excuses.

  <p> Grief................. 12. “Deep grief sometimes is almost like a specific location, a coordinate on a map of time. When you are standing in that forest of sorrow, you cannot imagine that you could ever find your way to a better place. But if someone can assure you that they themselves have stood in that same place, and now have moved on, sometimes this will bring hope.” — Elizabeth Gilbert
